Storing and Retrieving Aadhaar numbers in Binary Search Tree using it as an online voting platform. 

Voting as we all know is often associated with politics and is done more often
using the manual approach where voters queue up to vote for their choices.
Manual voting without any doubt exhibits chances of voting malpractices
and other negative vices. Those and many other reasons triggered the need
to shift from the manual voting system to a more sophisticated digitalized
voting platform. Today, voting does not only stops at politics but also extends
to other areas of human endeavours such as entertainment, sports, business,
Student unions, classrooms, fashion and style and so on and so forth. The
need to migrate from manual voting system to digital voting system has
brought about efficiency, free and fair election and as well as time utilisation.
Nowadays, vote count needs to be manually counted to declare the result
of the elections, which is both time consuming and labour intensive.
We are using Binary Search Tree to store Aadhaar Data as Aadhaar Number
is a 12 digit integer. Aadhaar Data includes Name and age of the person.
While giving vote the person will enter his Aadhaar number and if he is above
18 he can cast the vote. To exit the program 0 have to be pressed and the
program will show the name of representative who wins the elections.
Number of votes given to the representative will also be displayed.

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the
following properties:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the
node’s key
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than
the node’s key.
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. In this
project a Search tree with 6 childs is used.



Data structure used: Binary Search Tree
